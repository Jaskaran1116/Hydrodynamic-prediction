# Introduction 

The resistance provided by a ship to move through water can be categorised into two distinct components: frictional resistance and residual resistance. The dataset that we are incorporating for this experiment involves working with residual resistance. In this analysis we wish to explain how residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement is influenced by different factors such as velocity, buoyancy, Froude number, etc. 

The Delft dataset contains 308 full-scale experiments which were performed at the Delft Ship Hydrodynamic to predict the hydrodynamic performance of sailing yachts and estimate the required propulsive power. Essential inputs include the basic null dimenstion and boat velocity. There are 22 different hull forms in these experiments, all of which is derived from a parent that closely relates to Frans Mass ' 'Standfast  43'. The variable definitions and attribute information is as follows: 

#### Explanatory Variables: 
- (V1) Longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy, adimensional 
- (V2) Prismatic coefficient, adimensional 
- (V3) Length-displacement ratio, adimensional  
- (V4) Beam-draught ratio, adimensional 
- (V5) Length-Beam ratio, adimensional 
- (V6) Froude number, adimensional

#### Response Variable 
- (V7) The measured variable is the residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement.
